# Updating BetterDB Monitor

Newer releases ship **new features and security fixes**, so we recommend keeping
BetterDB Monitor up to date. When a newer version is available, an update banner
appears at the top of the dashboard showing the current and latest versions.

Where it can, the banner detects how your instance was launched (Docker, npx, or
a global install) and offers a one-click **copy** of the exact upgrade command.
This page is the complete reference, including the cases the banner can't
auto-detect (Kubernetes, custom deployments).

> **Your data is safe across upgrades.** Metrics, connections, audit logs, and
> settings live in the BetterDB data volume/directory, not in the application
> image or package. Upgrading replaces only the application. Keep pointing the
> new version at the same volume (Docker) or the same `BETTERDB_DATA_DIR`
> (CLI) and your history carries over.

## Check your current version

- **Dashboard** — the version is shown at the bottom of the sidebar, and in the
  update banner (`current → latest`).
- **API** — `GET /version` returns the current version, the latest known
  version, and whether an update is available:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:3001/version
  ```

## Docker

Pull the latest image, then recreate the container against your existing data
volume:

```bash
docker pull betterdb/monitor:latest

# Recreate the container (replace the name/flags with your own run command)
docker rm -f betterdb 2>/dev/null
docker run -d \
  --name betterdb \
  -p 3001:3001 \
  -v betterdb-data:/app/data \
  -e BETTERDB_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key \
  betterdb/monitor:latest
```

Pin a specific version instead of `latest` when you want reproducible
deployments, e.g. `betterdb/monitor:<version>` using the tag from the
[release notes](#release-notes).

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Compose recreates only the containers whose image changed and preserves named
volumes, so your data is retained automatically.

### Podman

```bash
podman pull betterdb/monitor:latest
# then recreate the container as in the Docker example above
```

## CLI (npm / pnpm / yarn / npx)

The CLI is published to npm as
[`@betterdb/monitor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@betterdb/monitor).

### Ephemeral runners (npx / dlx)

If you launched the CLI with a runner, just re-run it with `@latest` — this is
what the update banner suggests when it detects one. Pin `@latest` to bypass any
locally cached copy:

```bash
npx @betterdb/monitor@latest        # npm
pnpm dlx @betterdb/monitor@latest   # pnpm
yarn dlx @betterdb/monitor@latest   # Yarn Berry (v2+)
```

### Global install

If you installed the CLI globally, upgrade it in place:

```bash
npm install -g @betterdb/monitor@latest    # npm
pnpm add -g @betterdb/monitor@latest       # pnpm
yarn global add @betterdb/monitor@latest   # Yarn Classic (v1) — Berry dropped `yarn global`, use `yarn dlx` above
```

Your configuration and stored data live in `~/.betterdb` (or `BETTERDB_DATA_DIR`)
and are untouched by re-installing.

## Kubernetes

**Official Helm chart** (see the [Kubernetes guide](kubernetes)): each chart
release pins the image to the version it was published for, so updating is
just pulling the newer chart:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade betterdb-monitor betterdb/betterdb-monitor \
  --namespace betterdb --reuse-values
```

Don't override `image.tag` to update — leave it empty and let the chart's
`appVersion` drive the image, so chart and app versions move together and
`helm rollback` restores both.

**Plain manifests**: update the image tag on your deployment:

```bash
# replace <version> with the release you are moving to (see the release notes below)
kubectl set image deployment/betterdb betterdb=betterdb/monitor:<version>
```

Use a versioned tag rather than `latest` so rollouts are deterministic and
roll-backable. Historical data lives in your storage backend (`STORAGE_TYPE`),
not the pod, so it survives rollouts as long as you keep pointing at the same
PostgreSQL instance — with in-memory storage it is lost on every restart.

## After updating

- The banner disappears automatically once the running version matches the
  latest release.
- Dismissing the banner hides it only until the *next* newer version is
  published — it is not a permanent opt-out.
- BetterDB checks for updates about once an hour. Tune this with the
  `VERSION_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` environment variable (see
  [Configuration](configuration)).

## Release notes

Every banner links to the release notes for the target version. You can also
browse all releases on
[GitHub](https://github.com/betterdb-inc/monitor/releases).
