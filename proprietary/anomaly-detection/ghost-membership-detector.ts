/**
 * Detects endpoint-identity faults readable from a single node's `CLUSTER NODES`
 * view. Three distinct upstream faults share one signature family — an `ip:port`
 * endpoint that does not map cleanly to exactly one healthy node-id — so they are
 * reported under one metric with a `reason` discriminator.
 *
 * `stale_twin` (valkey-io/valkey#1757) — "CLUSTER RESET forgets other nodes, but
 * they don't forget you." A `CLUSTER RESET` (or a plain restart that re-provisions
 * the node's identity) wipes the resetting node's own view of the cluster, but the
 * *other* nodes keep it. On a HARD reset the node comes back with a brand-new
 * node-id + fresh `configEpoch 0`, while its *old* node-id lingers in every peer's
 * table as `fail`/`fail?`/`noaddr` — the peers never got a `CLUSTER FORGET`. The
 * result is a **ghost**: one endpoint claimed by two distinct node-ids, a stale
 * dead identity remembered alongside the live one that occupies the endpoint now.
 *
 * `live_endpoint_collision` (valkey-io/valkey#2768) — the same endpoint claimed by
 * two or more distinct ids where **both twins are live**. Under CPU steal or
 * scheduling starvation a node's address discovery picks up the wrong address and
 * gossips it, so two healthy nodes advertise one endpoint. Failover then cannot
 * select a correct primary, replicas try to `PSYNC` to themselves, and clients are
 * routed to the wrong node. The dead-twin logic above explicitly excludes this
 * case (it requires one twin to be a ghost), which is why it needs its own reason.
 *
 * `loopback_flip` (valkey-io/valkey#2768, severe variant) — the address a node
 * mis-discovered is a loopback/localhost address while its peers use routable
 * ones. This is the smoking gun for the same fault, and it is reported separately
 * because it is unambiguous and unrecoverable without operator action
 * (`cluster-announce-ip`). A cluster where *every* node is on loopback is a normal
 * local development topology and is never flagged.
 *
 * The upstream fixes live in the engine and are unresolved. We can't fix them, but
 * we can surface the residue and tell the operator exactly what to do about it.
 *
 * This is the stateless, high-precision Layer 1 of the detector: it fires only on
 * signatures visible in a single snapshot. The transient ~15s re-MEET/handshake
 * churn window, and the FORGET-then-rejoin case that needs membership history, are
 * left to the stateful Layer 2 — they self-heal or need memory, and would be noisy
 * here.
