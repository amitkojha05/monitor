 * Sentinel endpoint drift (valkey-io/valkey#2158).
 *
 * Sentinel records the *resolved* address of a node rather than the hostname it
 * was configured with. In Kubernetes a replica's ephemeral pod IP therefore
 * leaks into Sentinel's view in place of the stable announced hostname, and once
 * the pod is rescheduled that recorded IP is stale: Sentinel and every client it
 * steers now point at a dead or wrong address. One report on the same issue also
 * shows a node ending up configured as a replica of itself.
 *
 * Unresolved upstream with no maintainer fix landed, and reproducible — a
 * durable hazard.
 *
 * ## The signal is a MIXED group, not "an IP is present"
 *
 * Sentinel normally stores IPs; a deployment that does not use hostname
 * announcement is entirely IP-based and perfectly healthy. A deployment that
 * DOES announce hostnames shows hostnames throughout. The fault is the mixture:
 * a group where hostnames are clearly in use, yet one member is carried as a raw
 * IP. That member is the one whose announcement was lost.
 *
 * Firing on "any raw IP" would alert on every IP-based Sentinel deployment in
 * existence, so the hostname-in-use test comes first and nothing is reported
 * without it.
