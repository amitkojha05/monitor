/**
 * Stateful Layer 2 of ghost-membership detection: the temporal case the snapshot
 * layer explicitly defers, catching a node that **reintroduces itself after a
 * `CLUSTER FORGET`** (valkey-io/valkey#2788).
 *
 * Since 8.1, `CLUSTER FORGET` only blacklists a node-id for `cluster-blacklist-ttl`
 * (its own config, 60s by default — NOT `cluster-node-timeout`, which defaults to
 * 15s and is tuned independently). Any peer that was not also given the FORGET
 * keeps gossiping the removed node, so once the ban lapses the handshake path
 * re-adds it. The operator believes they scaled the cluster down; the node
 * quietly comes back, often with a fresh `configEpoch`. Upstream PR #4090 only
 * blocks the rejoin *during* the blacklist window and explicitly leaves the
 * delayed reconnect unsolved, so the hazard outlives the fix.
 *
 * No single `CLUSTER NODES` snapshot shows this — the returned node just looks
 * like a member. It is only visible as a transition across polls:
 *
 *     present  ->  fully absent from the membership set  ->  present again
 *
 * The middle state is what separates a FORGET from ordinary churn. A node that
 * merely crashed or flapped stays in every peer's table flagged `fail`/`noaddr`,
 * so it never leaves the membership set and never trips this layer. Only an
 * explicit removal takes an id out of the table altogether.
 *
 * One instance holds one connection's history. The service owns the map of them
 * and must drop the instance in `onConnectionRemoved`.
