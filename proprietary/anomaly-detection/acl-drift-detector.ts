/**
 * ACL drift / live-reload confirmation (valkey-io/valkey#4355).
 *
 * Operators push ACLs with `ACL LOAD` or a config-management controller and then
 * have no cheap way to confirm the running server actually adopted the intended
 * ruleset — nor to notice when one node in a replication group is serving a
 * different ruleset than its peers. Upstream #4355 proposes an `ACL DIGEST`
 * command (an XOR of per-user hashes) for exactly this; the TSC vote is pending.
 *
 * The digest is trivially reproducible client-side today from `ACL LIST`, so the
 * advisory does not need to wait: it computes the same *shape* of digest (per-user
 * hash, XOR-combined) so that if `ACL DIGEST` ships, swapping the source is a
 * no-op with no change in behaviour.
 *
 * ## Digest algorithm
 *
 * Reproducible by hand, which matters for an auditable security signal:
 *
 *   1. Each `ACL LIST` line is `user <name> <rule> <rule> …`.
 *   2. The rule tokens are sorted lexicographically, so a server that reports the
 *      same ruleset in a different order digests identically. Case is preserved —
 *      key patterns and channel patterns are case-sensitive.
 *   3. Per-user digest = first 16 hex chars of `sha256("<name>\n<sorted rules>")`.
 *   4. Node digest = XOR of every per-user digest, as 8-byte values. XOR makes the
 *      node digest independent of user ordering and matches the upstream shape.
 *
 * ## Scope: within a replication group, NOT cluster-wide
 *
 * `groupKey` is a shared `master_replid`, which on a cluster identifies ONE SHARD
 * (a primary and its replicas) — not the cluster. So on a clustered deployment
 * this confirms each shard is internally consistent and never compares shards
 * against each other.
 *
 * That matters because cluster ACLs are expected to be uniform cluster-wide, and
 * the likeliest real drift — an `ACL LOAD` that missed one primary — is precisely
 * cross-shard, so it lands in separate groups and is NOT detected. The scoping
 * matches config-drift's, so the two are consistent, but do not read this as
 * cluster-wide ACL verification. Closing the gap needs a cluster-wide grouping
 * path, which is not implemented here.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT carried out of this module
 *
 * Rule bodies. A finding names usernames and digests only — never key patterns,
 * channel patterns, command rules, or password hashes. `ACL LIST` output contains
 * hashed passwords (`#<sha256>`) and the key patterns a user can reach; pushing
 * those into the anomaly store and out through webhook payloads would turn a
 * consistency advisory into a credential-disclosure channel.
