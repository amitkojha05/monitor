 * under load and during rolling upgrades (valkey#4340).
 *
 * Nodes that appear or disappear between snapshots are deliberately NOT a
 * failover: scaling and node loss are their own events, and reporting them here
 * would make every topology change look like a promotion.
 *
 * Neither is a lone `configEpoch` bump. Epochs advance on `CLUSTER BUMPEPOCH`
 * and on the ownership claim during resharding, with no failover involved.
 * Every real failover promotes a replica, so `role_change` already covers them
 * — treating the epoch as sufficient on its own would page on routine
 * rebalancing. It stays in `reasons` when it accompanies a genuine promotion,
 * where it is useful detail.
